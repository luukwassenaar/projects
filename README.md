Welcome to my projects repository! As a skilled data scientist with experience in Python, SQL, EAD, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization, I am excited to showcase my real-world projects that demonstrate my expertise in these areas. From predictive modeling to data exploration and analysis, my projects offer a glimpse into my problem-solving skills and passion for using data to drive informed decision-making. 

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work and I look forward to discussing how my skills can contribute to your team.

My projects include:

1. Customer Churn Prediction:
This project will utilize several machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn for Telco. It will show the build of a function that 
applies and evaluates the algorithms simultanously and uses gridsearch to find the best hyper parameters for each algorithm.

2. Customer and Product Analysis:
This project we will be analysing the scale model car database using SQL to answer following questions:
- Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?
- Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
- Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

3. Heart Attack Prediction:
This project will utilize several machine learning techniques to predict heart attacks.

4. Item-Based Recommender System:
This project will focus on building a fashion recommender system for H&M using Item-Based Recommendation. It will also evaluate the system 
based on its accuracy in predicting the purchase of a product.

5. NBA Positions & Assists Prediction
Two of the big predictive modeling topics in data science are regression and classification, which is why I have used both in our research. 
Classification is used to predict an NBA player's position based on various basketball statistics and regression is used to predict the assists 
per game of an NBA player based on other basketball statistics.
